                    For the recent Github Game Jam, the game design club that I participate in made a small game.
                    Very small, we had a month to work, but in true high-school fashion we did it in the last 2 days.
                    I was the one to provide all of the ingame sprites and feel like the entire game came out quite well despite its brevity.

At one point this website hosted off-site images via drive, after that proved unreliable, annoying to implement, and luggish, i have switched to the far more logical option of using Imgur.
May fast loading times and easily pastable links be with you.

                   Drew this on my s22, I can say that the larger screen feels way better and I really enjoy the way if feels like my pen is just gliding across the screen.
                   Thats probably because I havent completeley worn out the rubber tip yet, or just due to the novelty of a brand new device. I also made some changes to the site,
                   I can save space and have better organization if I keep the images hosted off-site, so I decided to use drive as there is really no danger of it shuting down. 
                   There was some trouble embedding the link, ofcourse Google would never let me just link the image as any respectable company would do, but with a quick coversion, the image should be showing up jsut fine.

                    Decided to give 3D modeling a shot. Because I still dont have a proper drawing tablet, I dwnloaded this progtam called Nomad Sculpt onto my new S22 Ultra. The program is perfectly
                    fine, if not a bit cramped on a phone, and is almost identical to Blender's ZBrush from what ive heard.
                    You can find my model in the little "NEW CONTENT" popup on the front page, it probably wont be too good for animation, and the hands are off, but for a first attempt, im proud of it.
                    I included a download of the model as i find it prints rather well with the propper supports and settings. Ill be sure to mess around with suclpting soon, and might even give 3D animation a shot,
                    the actual animating part seems way easier than traditional 2D animation, so my only hurdle is making a suitable model.

                    My highschool has a coding club, and sometimes we have game jams. For the first one, me and one other person
                    (although we were a group of 5) made a cool little aracde game. It's far from perfect, and dosent have all the features
                    I originally intended it to, but it works. Ill try to get the game running on the website eventually, and post some of the unused art in the sprites
                    section of my archive that im planning to add someday.

                    I abandoned this project a while ago, but after someone I knew started work on their own website, I decided to continute this project.
                    I finally added a horizontal scrollbar to the "collection section of my website, and I added a "functional" art browser. Clicking of the images will open the file.
                    In the future, ill rework the games section and moves some of the files to a external server.
                    I also need to wait till construction is over at my house to get images for my collection.
